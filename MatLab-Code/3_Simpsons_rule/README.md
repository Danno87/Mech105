# Simpsons_rule
## (Using 1/3 with Trapezoidal rule if needed)

### This function will use you x and y values with respect to x and then apply the simpsons 1/3 rule if it has an odd row number, or if the rows are even will apply the trapezoidal rule to the last input and add both the simpsons and tapezoidal rule for the answer of I.

## Inputs must be in a column not a row!!!
### x = the x values of evenly spaced points from xa to xb
### y = the f(x) values that are the answer of the functions

## Outputs
### I = answer from eather simpson 1/3 rule or both simpson 1/3 and trap rule

## Limitations
### This as of right now does not have a limitation i'm aware of, but I would like to work on creating a for or while loop for the middle numbers to make the code more effecient.
